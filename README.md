# A Study of Metaphor Inference Using BERT Language Model

In this study, I propose to investigate the ability of the BERT language model in metaphor interpretation by designing a Metaphor Property Probing Task. Specifically, this involves the design of a masked word prediction task. Inspired by the work of He et al. (2022) on 'as-as' simile structures, for instance, as dark as night, I adapted their approach to curate new datasets focused on adjective-noun copula metaphors for this study: 
(1) metaphor datasets collected from both general corpus and human-designed questions
(2) a non-metaphor dataset sourced from COCA corpus.

This repository includes the codes,datasets and results presented in this study.
