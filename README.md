# A Study of Metaphor Inference Using BERT Language Model

In this study, I propose to investigate the ability of BERT language model in metaphor interpretation by designing a Metaphor Property Probing Task. Specifically, this involves the design of a masked word prediction
task. Inspired by the work of He et al. (2022) on ‘as-as’ simile structures,for instance, as dark as night, I adapted their approach to curate two new datasets focused on adjective-noun copula metaphors for this study: (1) a metaphor dataset collected from both general corpus and human-designed
questions, and (2) a non-metaphor dataset sourced from COCA corpus.
